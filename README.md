# Who am I

Strong believer in open source software.

As a computer science student I dive into different areas of software development. To me programming is 
coolest way to work with a computer ðŸ”¥ ... ðŸ˜„. I espeally worked with JavaScript, Rust and C#.

## What occupies me

After my journay for getting a degree in Bachelor of Science for Computer Science, I am seeking an employment in software development.

## Significant Projects in Rust

I mainly developed a few CLI Applications

- [Tool to manage daily, monthly and yearly journals]
- [Save and load folder paths]
- Contributing to Ion shell, default shell of redox os.
  [Link][Ion shell git lab] to repository on gitlab and [link][Ion shell git hub] to mirro on github.
- For a few terms of my study for computer science I maintained [a CLI application to manage users on ohm-th HPC][th usermanagement]. 

Planning to build some TUI Stuff. 

## Other places where I contribute/develop

- As [bool_purist][profile on redox os] on the gitlab of redox os.
