# Who am I

Strong believer in open source software.

As a computer science student I dive into different areas of software development. To me programming is 
coolest way to work with a computer ðŸ”¥ ... ðŸ˜„. 

## What occupies me

During my tour through of programming languages I met Ferris and become a aspiring rustacean ðŸ¦€ 

## Current Projects in rust.

I develop a few CLI Applications

- [Tool to manage daily, monthly and yearly journals]
- [Save and load folder paths]

Planning to build some TUI Stuff.
